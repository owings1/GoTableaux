Version 2.1
    Added expansion of new lines in doc comments to HTML paragraph elements in standard doclet.
Version 2
    Fixed ignore command so it actually works.
    Fixed constructor case bug, PHP4 style constructors were not being recognised as such if the method name was a different case to the class name.
    Fixed numerous small CSS problems in standard doclet.
    Fixed case problem in links in package frame writer in standard doclet.
    Added merging of superclass description into class for class description and overrided methods. This is added as a separate pass of the class heirarchy since all class data must be collected before we can merge.
    Fixed recursive references error in PHP5 for asort in classWriter.php by changing asort for ksort (found by Andrew McMurry <amcmurry@chip.org>)
    Fixed get_class() case problem in PHP5 by using strtolower() with all instances of get_class() (found by Andrew McMurry <amcmurry@chip.org>)

    Fixed bugs in #1306941

    Uses doclet classes to control output.
Version 1.5
    Added warning if using default output directory (sugguested by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    No longer reads overview comment from file_path if exists, now it must be explicitly specified in config (sugguested by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Fixed package name addition to class tree (found by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Changed the way class trees are generated, package trees now include other package classes if they inherit from them (ala Javadoc)
    Opens a stream to stderr if STDERR constant not found (thanks to Gabe Sidler <sidler@teamup.com>)
    Fixed infinite loop when looking in sub directories (thanks to Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Replaced "hide_private" directive with "public", "protected" and "private" directives that mirror the equivalent Javadoc options
    Fixed not picking up member variables defined with "public" keyword
    Adjusted package comment behaviour, will now look for file named "package.html" in the package directory as well as a file named "<package>.html" in the "package_comment_dir" (sugguested to Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Added ability to set which config file to use in "PHPDoctor" environment variable
    Removed dependancy of glob() flag GLOB_ONLYDIR which does not exist pre PHP 4.3.3 on Win32 (found by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Fixed problem with @see tag links pointing to incorrect package name (found by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Execution halts if a file to be parsed can not be found (sugguested by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Extended summary and package external comment support. Now behaves like Javadoc support including parsing out of Javadoc tags
    Changed the way PHPDoctor looks for the separation between the doc comment short and main descriptions, now ignores HTML tags used to signify a line end (ie. a closing paragraph tag)
    Added getObject() function which can find an element within the parsed tokens without knowing its package or class, used to fully qualify the name of an element to link to if only the elements name is given.
    Fixed error in parseLink() where it referenced a 'globals' array member which should have been 'params' (found by Rastislav Kassak <kasou.sk@gmail.com>)

    Fixed PHP notice when supplying both files and a file list, now reads both and concatinates them together (found by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Fixed mis-naming of file_path option (found by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Fixed error with not identifying whether a files path is relative or full, should no longer cause relative paths to not be found (found by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Added subdirs option that causes PHPDoctor to also search all sub directories of the given file_path
    Added package names to class tree output and above page title (sugguested by Stefano <stefano@rausch-e.net>)
    Added exploding of package directories to subdirs when package name includes a slash or a dot
    Fixed automatically making private object member variables beginning with an underscore
    Fixed splitting of short description from long description, now the dot must be the last char of a word (fixes finding dot into inline link tags)

    Added support for default parameter and member variable values
