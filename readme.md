GoTableaux
==========

About
-----

### Description
<p>A framework for logic tableaux generators in multiple logics, including modal and many-valued.</p>

### History
<p>This project originated from an auxiliary project for my dissertation, in which I develop a novel many-valued propositional logic, and explore its applications. 
	This software began as a proof generator (using tableaux) for my logic (called GO), in order to quickly generate well-formatted proofs for many philosophically interesting inferences.</p>

The beginnings of a web interface are up. It can be viewed at:

Status
------

<p>In addition to working on improvements to the web interface, I am in the process of expanding it into a more general framework to allow easy extensions for other logics.</p>
