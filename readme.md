GoTableaux
==========

<p>A framework for logic tableaux generators in multiple logics, including modal and many-valued.</p>

<p>This came out of a side project for my dissertation, where I develop a novel many-valued propositional logic, and explore its applications. 
	This software began as a proof generator (using tableaux) for my logic, in order to prove philosophically interesting inferences.</p>

<p>I am currently in the process of expanding it into a more general framework to allow easy extensions for other logics.</p>
