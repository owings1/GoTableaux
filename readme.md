About

### Description
<p>
	A multi-logic tableaux proof generator.
</p>
<p>
	Logics implemented:
	- Classical Propositional Logic (CPL)
	- First Degree Entailment (FDE)
	- Logic of Paradox (LP)
	- Strong Kleene (K3)
	- GO
</p>

### History
<p>
	This project originated from an auxiliary project for my dissertation, in which I develop a many-valued propositional logic (which I call GO), and explore its applications. 
	This software began as a tableaux proof generator for GO, so I could quickly generate LaTeX proofs for any argument.
</p>

### Status
<p>
	In addition to starting to work on a web interface, I am expanding the framework to accommodate new logics. Current plans include:
	- ≈Åukasiewicz
	- Weak Kleene
	- Bochvar
	- Normal Modal Logic (K)
	- Modal GO
</p>
