GoTableaux
==========

About
-----

### Description
<p>A framework for logic tableaux generators in multiple logics, including modal and many-valued.</p>

### History
<p>This project originated from an auxiliary project for my dissertation, in which I develop a novel many-valued propositional logic, and explore its applications. 
	This software began as a proof generator (using tableaux) for my logic (called GO), in order to prove philosophically interesting inferences.</p>

Status
------
<p>The beginnings of a web interface are up. It can be viewed at:</p>

>http://logic.dougowings.net/

<p>I am currently in the process of expanding it into a more general framework to allow easy extensions for other logics.</p>
